### Problem Statement :
Automation mechanism for image capturing, processing,standardization evaluation, classification , leading to better decision leading to better decision making results for various programs.

## Idea :
The Idea is to build a web-application which have various portal for different
Government programs, each portal have image capturing and different document
uploading features. The validation and type defining of images are done by ML
(Google Vision AI) , Deep Learning Algorithm (CNN).
## Idea Description :
• A Hybrid web based application will be created.
• The application will have individual portal for every Government Programs.
• Each portal have access to features/tools like
- Image Capturing tool with Geo tag.
- Documents and Images Uploading Features 
Idea Description (continue):
• The application automatically validate and define the type of images.
• Object
• Labels
• Logos
• Text
• Properties
• Validation and types of information will show on portals.
• Technical Approach :
• Image Classification / ML Process : Google Vision AI/CNN Algorithm
• Geo-Tag (Location Identification) : Geotagger python framework
• OCR (Documents OCR Process) : 
#### SOLUTION
▪ As our idea is describe in previous slide, that we make a platform which will
works as a bridge to fulfill the gaps between digital and physical workflows. With
newly found encouragement to be creative, people are finding new ways to deal
with the current reality.
▪ Even though the construction industry has traditionally been slow to adopt the new
technology, our current reality means we are leaning on it more than ever to be
efficient and remain productive.
▪ It will be also helpful for Municipalities to updating their process for permit
application and e-procurement to accommodate new technology.
SOLUTION continued..
▪ Through this platform we can capture more data in the field, the more information
can be shared with the team members who are currently not on sites. The daily
reporting of tasks completed in the field becomes key.
▪ And if an inspector don’t need to be on-site, it can be challenge to get timely
information to make important decisions. So through this platform the inspector
can also check the images validation.
POST INSPECTION WORKFLOW :
As after an inspection, electronics records help make it all happen.
▪ When inspection notes are digital and added to working plans , there is no delay
waiting for a report from an inspector. They’re immediately available to act on.
▪ As it is a cloud based platform, which means all photos and annotations with
labels, OCR and image size can remain permanently within the job file. They are
also within the context of the sites progress so the end user can see what happened
on the work after the inspection.
▪ This platform will be deals with balancing efficiency with regulations which
means the contractors, municipalities and the public are confident with the
outcomes.

 Used For Identity and Fraud Detection
 
 1. Structured Formatted OCR Text Extraction
• High Resolution Compression (Slow Processing)
• Using ML Algorithm
• Low Level Compression (Fast Processing)
• Simple PIL method

2. Images Compression
• Text Extracted From Images/Pdfs under any Scheme will be stored as structured
format like data frame or in excel or csv format.
• And this will be used at Admin side for validating the Employment Identity or
details
