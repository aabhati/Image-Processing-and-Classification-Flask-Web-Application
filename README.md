### Project :
Automation mechanism for image capturing, processing,standardization evaluation, classification , leading to better decision leading to better decision making results for various Govt. programs.

Web-application which have various portal for different
Government programs, each portal have image capturing and different document
uploading features. The validation and type defining of images are done by ML
(Google Vision AI) , Deep Learning Algorithm (CNN).
Description :
• The application have individual portal for every Government Programs.
• Each portal have access to features/tools like
- Image Capturing tool with Geo tag.
- Documents and Images Uploading Features 
• The application automatically validate and define the type of images.
• Object
• Labels
• Logos
• Text
• Properties
• Validation and types of information will show on portals.
• Technical Approach :
• Image Classification / ML Process : Google Vision AI/CNN Algorithm
• Geo-Tag (Location Identification) : Geotagger python framework
• OCR (Documents OCR Process) :

 Used For Identity and Fraud Detection
 
 1. Structured Formatted OCR Text Extraction
 • Text Extracted From Images/Pdfs under any Scheme stored as structured
format like data frame or in excel or csv format.
• And this will be used at Admin side for validating the Employment Identity or
details


2. Images Compression
• High Resolution Compression (Slow Processing)
• Using ML Algorithm
• Low Level Compression (Fast Processing)
• Simple PIL method
